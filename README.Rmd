## Purpose

This repository contains all the work generated for Management Science Through Spreadsheed from SNHU.  I am using the workflow of github becuase I really prefer the reliability and tracking involved.  I have gotten used to it programming in R, so I am extending that to my school work.

## Structure

There will be a folder for each of the 8 modules and also for the final project.  If a module includes work to be done for the final project I will work on it in a branch, merge it with the main, but keep the branch so the work is easily retrievable and viewable.
